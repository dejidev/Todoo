# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



Requirements:

Task List:

Display a list of tasks, each with a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., pending, completed).

Allow users to filter tasks based on their status.

Task Creation and Editing:

Implement functionality to add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.

Allow users to edit existing tasks.

Responsive Design:

Ensure that the dashboard is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
